Can't speak for the chicken and mushroom crepe since I didn't get to try it, but everything else truthfully fell short of expectations. The seafood crepe not only lacked flavor, but also was too creamy and heavy for my taste. The large pieces of shrimp and scallops saved the dish, but overall, the crepe was just okay. Eggs benedict here is definitely not a stand-out dish, either. The muffin was too hard and I've definitely had better hollandaise sauce.</td>\n",

We ate almost everything on the menu - although their French Onion Soup wasn't spectacular, their baked goat cheese, fresh French bread and steaks were to die for.  They had a great wine selection, and our server, Angie, was phenomenal.  She had great wine recommendations and was overall a joy to have.  Would definitely eat here again!  Thank you George at the Paris for everything!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3  Charming resturant that looks like it would be heavily overpriced. Been here twice now and really enoued the onion soup, they are not stingey on the gruyer cheese! Endive and pear salad was a bit salty for my taste but there's plenty more to choose from. Baugettes were real tasty!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "4  This review is long overdue!   I have been eating here for years, it is always on my \"must have\" list when visiting vegas. I have NEVER been disappointed with the food or service in the many years I have eaten here.   I love everything on the menu. EVERYTHING. Honestly you cant go wrong. The french onion soup, the bread, the steaks, the seafood, dessert - it is all fabulous.   Thank you mon ami for being my favorite vegas restaurant!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

We came here for brunch during peak hour, but luckily had a reservation so ended up waiting only a few minutes.   Our table ordered Bordelaise Steak Frites (with caramelized onion and red wine sauce); Chicken and Mushroom Crepe (with kale and brie); Seafood Crepe (with scallops, shrimp, peas and cream); Onion soup; and Eggs Benedict (with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce).   The steak frites and onion soup were the best things we ordered. Steak frites came with a huge chunk of juicy steak and a side of crispy, salted fries. Onion soup was also a nice, big portion, but I can't say it stood out from other onion soups I've had. Can't speak for the chicken and mushroom crepe since I didn't get to try it, but everything else truthfully fell short of expectations. The seafood crepe not only lacked flavor, but also was too creamy and heavy for my taste. The large pieces of shrimp and scallops saved the dish, but overall, the crepe was just okay. Eggs benedict here is definitely not a stand-out dish, either. The muffin was too hard and I've definitely had better hollandaise sauce.</td>\n",

       "0  Other than being right across the Fountains of Bellagio, I'm not quite sure what the hype is about this place. We came here for brunch during peak hour, but luckily had a reservation so ended up waiting only a few minutes.   Our table ordered Bordelaise Steak Frites (with caramelized onion and red wine sauce); Chicken and Mushroom Crepe (with kale and brie); Seafood Crepe (with scallops, shrimp, peas and cream); Onion soup; and Eggs Benedict (with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce).   The steak frites and onion soup were the best things we ordered. Steak frites came with a huge chunk of juicy steak and a side of crispy, salted fries. Onion soup was also a nice, big portion, but I can't say it stood out from other onion soups I've had. Can't speak for the chicken and mushroom crepe since I didn't get to try it, but everything else truthfully fell short of expectations. The seafood crepe not only lacked flavor, but also was too creamy and heavy for my taste. The large pieces of shrimp and scallops saved the dish, but overall, the crepe was just okay. Eggs benedict here is definitely not a stand-out dish, either. The muffin was too hard and I've definitely had better hollandaise sauce.   \n",
       "1  French onion soup was watery with little taste.  We sent it back and were refunded the cost.  The wait staff also forgot that we were there for a birthday and didn't bring out a candle for dessert.  On the plus side my trout was wonderful and my wife enjoyed her scallops.  We've been a number of times but this last meal has tarnished that \"must visit\" image.  Pricing is reasonable for Vegas and reservations can usual be booked same day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "2  Where to begin!  Now our dining experience here was not a common one - we were treated to dinner here.  We ate almost everything on the menu - although their French Onion Soup wasn't spectacular, their baked goat cheese, fresh French bread and steaks were to die for.  They had a great wine selection, and our server, Angie, was phenomenal.  She had great wine recommendations and was overall a joy to have.  Would definitely eat here again!
